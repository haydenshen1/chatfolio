    motivation: >
      My fascination with programming began with writing simple Python code when I was in high school, igniting a spark that led me to pursue a degree in Computer Science. 
      It was the thrill of creating my first program, albeit just a few lines of code, that set me on this path.
      Moreover, my experience as a software engineer further solidified my passion. 
      Beyond programming, I found joy in the collaborative process of software development and the dynamic teamwork required to deliver impactful products to customers.
