  ['Challenging Project Experience',
   "I once took on a leadership role in a project that required careful coordination and problem-solving skills. The project was critical for our release timeline, but it presented some obstacles. Firstly, the senior developer, who held expertise in the domain, was on vacation, leaving me to navigate potential issues without his guidance. Some tasks had interdependencies, making it crucial to maintain communication among team members. There was also difficulty in communication posed by engineers in the satellite office in India, resulting in limited communication due to time differences. To overcome these obstacles, I took proactive steps. Before the senior developer's departure, I gathered necessary information and insights from him, ensuring I was equipped to proceed in his absence. I then carefully documented my approach and wrote re-usable test cases, allowing other team members to follow my solutions. To maintain alignment across teams, I actively held virtual meetings with engineers in India, ensuring they were kept in the loop. Through these efforts, I successfully navigated the challenges and delivered the project on time."],
  ['Motivation for Career in Software Development',
   'I was first introduced to programming during high school and found my passion when I created my first program, even though it was probably just 5 lines of simple Python code. The fact that I made a program was sparking, motivating me to pursue a degree in Computer Science. That was the initial motivation. The second motivation came from my co-op experience as a software engineer. I discovered my passion for not only programming but also the collaborative process of software development and working with teams to deliver impactful products to customers.'],
  ['Interesting Facts',
   'I was a vegan once in my life. I had a mentally stressful and struggling time in high school due to my bad performance. I desperately wanted to change something in my life. I had a good friend of mine who was smart and good at sports, and he was a vegetarian. I wanted to perform like him and tried to stop eating meats. Thanks to that, I started feeling better and things in life went in good directions. After some months, I learned about industrialized food and how humans mistreat animals for food production. I was ashamed of my ignorance and became vegan, meaning I stopped eating any animal products including eggs, milk, cheese, etc. I stopped using shampoo and body soap and any products that involve animal tests. I did not eat meat for one whole year, and eventually I quit being vegan.'],
  ['Staying Updated with Trends', 'I read news and check tech-related contents.'],
  ['Approach with Team Members',

  ['Dream Jobs When Younger',
   'I had several dream jobs when I was younger. In kindergarten, I wanted to become a footballer because I liked watching the anime about American football that was popular in Japan. In primary school, I enjoyed telling jokes to people and making them laugh and happy, so I wanted to become a comedian. In middle school, I thought being able to speak multiple languages was cool, so I wanted to become a translator. In high school, I learned about many political issues between Japan and China. I wanted to study international relations and build a positive cultural bridge in the future to improve the relationship between Japan and China. Also in high school, I enjoyed editing videos and making posters with Photoshop. I took a digital art class and wanted to learn more in university. I was initially not familiar with programming, but my friend invited me to take a programming course together in grade 11. I learned basic programming in Python and I really enjoyed it. I had an epiphany that this is what I want to specialize in. The first program I wrote was to generate Fibonacci series using a loop. In grade 12, I took an intro to computer science course and learned object-oriented programming with Java. I continued my journey of programming by majoring in Computer Science in university. I took many interesting courses like information security, big data, artificial intelligence, video game development, mobile app development, building UI, and numerical analysis. During my internship at Introhive, I realized I enjoy software development as much as I love programming. That’s how I decided to pursue a career in software development.']
